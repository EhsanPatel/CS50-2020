This problem included a series of different SQL commands to query specific data about films from a large database.

The type of problems were about asking how many of a specific circumstance occurred in the database

For Example:
* How many times was Actor 1 in a movie with Actor 2
* What were the top five movies that Actor X starred in (in order)

## Houses

The solution for houses required using python to first read a csv file and organize the contents into a database.

Based on the command line arguments inputted, an SQL command is then used to get the results which are formatted upon printing to the command line
